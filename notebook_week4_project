With wide-open spaces and safe, affluent cities, the benefits of living in the Great White North are clear. Canada is one of the most safe, secure and happy nations on the planet with numerous additional perks from polar bears to the Northern Lights. Thousands of individuals make the move across the Atlantic every year in search of better Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospitals. \nThis Project aim to create an analysis of features for individuals migrating to Scarborough to search for the best neighbourhood as a proportional analysis between neighbourhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both fresh and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\nIt will help persons to get cognizance of the area and neighbourhood before moving into a new city, state, country."

It is located directly north of York, Old Toronto and East York, between Etobicoke to the west and Scarborough to the east. As of the 2016 Census, it had a population of 869,401. It was first created as a township in 1922 out of the northern part of the former township of York, a municipality that was located along the western border of Old Toronto. Following its inclusion in Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, it was one of the fastest-growing parts of the region due to its proximity to Old Toronto. It was declared a borough in 1967, and later became a city in 1979, attracting high-density residences, rapid transit, and a number of corporate headquarters in North York City Centre, its central business district. In 1998, North York was amalgamated with the rest of Metropolitan Toronto to form the new city of Toronto and has since been a secondary economic hub of the city outside Downtown Toronto."
